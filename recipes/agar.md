# Agar Recipe (Base Layer for Slime Mold Growth)

## Ingredients
- 5g agar powder  
- 1 cup of spring water 

## Instructions
1. Combine agar and water in a small saucepan or jar.
2. Stir until dissolved.
3. Heat gently (stovetop or microwave) until bubbling.
4. Let cool slightly.

## Notes
- Store leftover agar in the fridge and reheat as needed. 
- Avoid boiling over — it foams fast.
