## Day 01 – November 14, 2025

**Initial Inoculation**

Spores arrived this morning. Inoculated both dishes (Sample A and B) on fresh agar poured last night.

### Setup Notes
- Agar layer approximately ¼ inch thick
- Spores placed orange side up
- One oat flake directly on each sclerotia, with several others scattered nearby
- Oats lightly moistened with spring water
- Tools and containers wiped with 70% isopropyl alcohol

### Environment
- Petri dishes placed inside Tupperware containers with medical tape over air holes
- Stored in a dark closet at stable, cool temperature

### Sample Details

**Sample A**  
- 9 oat flakes  
- Slightly uneven agar  
- Lid loosely fitted, taped closed

**Sample B**  
- 4 oat flakes  
- More evenly poured agar  
- Lid well sealed

### Observations
- No visible growth yet
- No condensation
- Expecting signs of activity within 24–48 hours

### Personal Notes
It smells like cooked seaweed. A little strange, but also kind of comforting. Hoping to see life stir tomorrow.
