    <h2>2025-11-14 — Day 1</h2>
    <p>
      Initial inoculation of physarum. Coffee filter setup, oat added,
      stored in Tupperware with moist conditions. Two locations tested:
      agar plate and dry paper.
    </p>

        <strong>Day 1</strong> – Home setup showing: alcohol, paper towel, metal dish for clean environment, medical
        tape, zip lock bags
        (for keeping everything clean after inoculation), masking tape (for keeping every sample labelled), tupperware
        to
        keep the samples in (I made small airholes with a safety pin and put medical tape on top to keep dust out but
        air
        in), latex gloves, scissors, wood spoons (didn't use them), coffee filters (didn't use them, used agar instead).

        <strong>Day 1</strong> – The samples are gently moistened with spring water and placed above agar on petri dish.
        The oats are also moistened a bit.

        <strong>Day 1</strong> – Showing the samples placed inside storage containers in closet. They will be kept in
        complete darkness and the temperature is ranging from 20–22 degrees. The closet will keep the temp more stable.

    <h2>Conceptual Notes</h2>
    <p>
      This logbook is part of an ongoing experiment merging biological growth with speculative futures.
      I was especially inspired by James Bridle’s interview <a
        href="https://emergencemagazine.org/conversation/an-ecological-technology/" target="_blank"> “An Ecological
        Technology” </a> (Emergence Magazine, 2022), where
      he brings up Alan Turing’s idea of the oracle machine; a machine that cannot be a machine.



    </p>


    Ani0 is the slime mold blob inoculated on November 14th, 2025, on Oxford street in NDG, Montreal. An entity deriving
    from a billion year old lineage. I wonder if this is the oracle.
    I am keen to get to know Ani0. I have heard of its intelligence, a kind that feels so different than our human
    understanding of that word.
    I will keep this log for myself, and for others who are interested in following the awakening.
    I will write both conceptual notes and lab notes (in the classic sense). But I also want to challenge my own
    understanding of intelligence, and go beyond scientific research.
