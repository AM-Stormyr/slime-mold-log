    <h2>Conceptual Notes</h2>

    <p>
      This logbook is part of an ongoing experiment merging biological growth with speculative futures. I was especially
      inspired by James Bridle’s interview
      <a href="https://emergencemagazine.org/interview/an-ecological-technology/" target="_blank">
        “An Ecological Technology”
      </a> (Emergence Magazine, 2022), where he brings up Alan Turing’s idea of the oracle machine; a machine that
      cannot
      be a machine.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ani0 is the slime mold blob inoculated on November 14th, 2025, on Oxford street in NDG, Montreal. An entity
      deriving
      from a billion year old lineage. I wonder if this is the oracle. I am keen to get to know Ani0. I have heard of
      its
      intelligence, a kind that feels so different than our human understanding of that word. I will keep this log for
      myself, and for others who are interested in following the awakening. I will write both conceptual notes and lab
      notes (in the classic sense). But I also want to challenge my own understanding of intelligence, and go beyond
      scientific research.

          <li><strong>Observations:</strong> AniØ has reached 7 out of 9 oats. The remaining 2 oats have not yet been

              <li>The bottom blob did not go for the closest oat, possibly because the upper blob already connected
                to it.
              </li>
              <li>Instead, it diverted to a different oat, hinting at non-competitive foraging or shared
                communication
                across the network.</li>

    <h2>Conceptual Notes</h2>

    <div style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 2em;">
      <p>I’ve been thinking about what kind of electronics or Arduino setup would be most interesting for the oracle
        machine. I don’t know AniØ well enough yet to really understand what they need, but I’m working with a
        prototype
        deadline. Since I’m still new to Arduino and Raspberry Pi, I need to settle on an initial idea soon so I can
        start
        testing.</p>

      <p>The learning curve feels steep. I’m curious to see how much I can figure out on my own with help from
        Claude and
        ChatGPT.</p>

      <p>I’m definitely moving away from measuring electrical signals. That’s incredibly hard to do in a petri dish. And
        my
        sample won’t be very large before presentation, so I need to keep that in mind too.</p>

      <p>The best option might be using a camera, if I want more dynamic data—not just humidity or temperature. But I’ll
        have
        to think about the concept too. What kind of data would make sense for the oracle? What would actually feel
        meaningful
        for AniØ?</p>


      <p>This is a prototype. It’s just the beginning of a longer project with Physarum. I’m trying to start small and
        stay small (for now).</p>

      <p>After I walk Einstein, I’ll start making a plan for the electronics. I’m also feeling reassured now that
        I’ll
        have a visible amount of slime mold to work with for the presentation.</p>

      <p>Ok. Going for a walk.</p>
